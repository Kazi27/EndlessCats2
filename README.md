# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: **Kazi Anwar**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Summary

**EndlessCats2** is the second iteration of an android app that **displays a scrollable list of cat images and gifs of all shapes and sizes from the CAT API! It displays three pieces of data, the id, url and image and makes an API call, uses recycler view along with a toast. It also looks more cohesive than before!**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üê±üêàüò∫**

## Notes

Although recycler views and adapters are super hard, UI/UX is fun!
