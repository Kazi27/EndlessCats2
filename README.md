# AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Kazi Anwar**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Summary

**EndlessCats** is an android app that **displays a scrollable list of cat images and gifs of all shapes and sizes from the CAT API! It displays three pieces of data, the id, url and image and makes an API call, uses recycler view along with a toast.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üê±üêàüò∫**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [X] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [ ] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

## Video Demo

## Notes

Recycler views and adapters are super hard!
